2. **Instant value** - They see real insights from their own data
3. **Proves capability** - Demonstrates AI quality without trial
4. **Creates urgency** - "Your competitors can see this public data too"
5. **Natural upsell** - "Now imagine what you'd learn from internal comments"

### Week 1-4 Execution Plan
